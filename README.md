## Installation Steps

2. `cd` into the root directory.
3. Run `open index.html` to view in the browser.

## Overview:
- *Goal of the Project*: Create functionality for Idea Box webpage, and creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from scratch following Style Guidelines. Implementing use of Event Delegation as a new lesson following previous projects. We implented the use of Semantic elements and delegated the use of `<div></div>` for styling purposes only. We practiced DRY and SRP coding.
- *Future Feature*: We discussed the possibilities that the bottom comment-bar of the <section> element could actually be designed as a button, nesting an <svg> element as well as a <P> (for "comment") and the "+" svg can transform into a "-" while it opens up a comment section for us to add more notes to the <p class="comment-input"> element.
